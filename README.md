## Purpose of this site

When I first graduated from my illustration and graphic design degree I struggled with creating a website, even with web hosting services that included tools to make the process easier. After learning HTML and CSS to a degree that let me create a functional static site, I feel this was a milestone in my progression though front-end development.
